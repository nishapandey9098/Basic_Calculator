# Basic_Calculator

Tkinter Calculator

A simple Calculator App built using Python Tkinter.
This project demonstrates the use of GUI programming in Python, covering layouts, buttons, labels, event handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

> Features

➕ Basic Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

🔄 Special Operations: Percentage (%), Negation (+/-)

🧮 Decimal support (.)

🧹 Clear All (AC) button

🟢 Responsive Buttons with Color Coding

📐 Centered Window on Launch

> How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/nishapandey9098/Basic_Calculator.git
cd Basic_Calculator


Run the calculator:

python calculator.py


> How It Works

The app uses Tkinter to build a GUI window.

Label → acts as the calculator display.

Buttons → generated dynamically using a grid layout.

Event Handling → clicking a button triggers button_clicked(value) function.

The calculator keeps track of:

A → first number

operator → chosen operation (+, -, ×, ÷,)

B → second number

It calculates the squares and its root.

It has the feature of backspace as well. 


> Learning Outcomes

By building this project, I learned:

How to create GUI apps using Tkinter

How to manage layouts using grid()

How to handle user interactions (button clicks)

How to store and process data for a calculator logic


> Future Improvements

Handle Division by Zero errors gracefully

Add Memory functions (M+, M-, MC, MR)

Improve styling with ttkbootstrap for a modern look
